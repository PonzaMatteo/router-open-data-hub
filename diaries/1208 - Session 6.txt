Activities Done:

- Consulted with professor on Challenge requirements on 7 Dec 2023


Results:

Some clarifications that we got from the discussion:-
- Understood that the bulk of the program should be on mapping the request and response to a predefined structure.
- Input by the user can be defined by our program, independent of what open data hub APIs expect
- HTTP server is not needed


Difficulties Found:

- Initially, we misunderstood the challenge requirements. Now, we have a clearer picture of what to do.
