Activities Done:

- read project specifications
- explore open data hub mobility and tourism APIs via the online Swagger

Results:

- We understood the project requirements and have an high level understanding of what we have to build
- Our next steps will be to try out the APIs on a simple Java program


--- Difficulties Found ---

1. In the requirements section of the challenge specification it's mentioned:
  
  Create a component that invoke two classes that call Open
  Data Hub APIs from different databases (these classes should
  have the same interface and should be plugged in)

We're unsure about what "plugged in" means in this context.
We assume that it refers to dependency injection.

2.  In the requirements section of the challenge specification it's mentioned:
      
  In case the parameters cannot be used to find the right API,
  the component should invoke each implementation until have
  some information returned.

We're not entirely sure if that means returning the results from both the APIs or only
from the first one.
